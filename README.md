# Scripture Songs

This repository contains a collection of scripture songs put to music. The lyrics come directly from (or are slightly modified from) the [World English Bible](https://worldenglish.bible/), which is in the public domain.

The music was generated using a paid-tier subscription on [Suno](https://suno.com). According to Suno's [terms of service](https://suno.com/terms), Suno assigns the rights to output generated with a paid-tier subscription to the user. FreelyGive is in turn releasing these songs to the public domain.

This act is in accord with Freely Give's desire to see Christian music no longer be dominated by money and fame, but by a desire to glorify the God who created us with a capacity and love for music.
